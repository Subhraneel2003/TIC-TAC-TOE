# TIC-TAC-TOE
This is a basic implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in the C programming language. The game is played between two players, where each player takes turns to mark an X or an O in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
